Solid mensuration is the branch of mathematics that deals with the measurement of solid figures, such as prisms, pyramids, cylinders, cones, spheres, and polyhedra. It involves calculating various properties of these figures, such as surface area, volume, lateral area, diagonal length, centroid, moment of inertia, and more.

If you are studying solid mensuration or need to refresh your skills, you may be looking for a reliable and comprehensive solution manual that can help you solve the problems and understand the concepts. One of the most popular textbooks on solid mensuration is *Solid Mensuration* by Willis F. Kern and James R. Bland, first published in 1934. This book covers all the topics of solid mensuration in a clear and logical way, with many examples and exercises.
  
However, finding a solution manual for this book can be challenging, as it is an old and rare book that may not be available in many libraries or online sources. Moreover, some of the solutions may be outdated or incorrect due to changes in notation or conventions over time. So how can you find the best solution manual for solid mensuration by Kern and Bland?
  
Here are some tips that can help you:
  
- Search online for PDF files or scanned copies of the solution manual. You may find some websites that offer free or paid downloads of the solution manual, such as Scribd[^1^] or Archive[^3^]. However, be careful about the quality and accuracy of these files, as they may not be complete or verified. Also, make sure you have permission to use them for your personal or academic purposes.
- Look for other textbooks or references that have similar problems and solutions to those in Kern and Bland's book. You may find some newer or more accessible books that cover solid mensuration in a similar way, such as *Solid Mensuration with Proofs* by Richard E. Johnson and G.E. Mowry, or *Solid Geometry* by N.D. Kazarinoff. You can use these books as supplementary sources to check your answers or learn different methods of solving the problems.
- Ask your instructor or classmates for help. If you are taking a course on solid mensuration or have access to a tutor or mentor, you can ask them for guidance or clarification on any problem or concept that you find difficult or confusing. They may have their own copies of the solution manual or know where to find one. They may also be able to explain the solutions in a simpler or more intuitive way.
- Use online calculators or tools to verify your answers. There are some websites that offer online calculators or tools that can help you compute various properties of solid figures, such as [Calculator Soup](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/geometry-solids/) or [Math Portal](https://www.mathportal.org/calculators/analytic-geometry/solid-geometry-calculator.php). You can use these tools to check your answers or get an idea of how to approach the problems.

Finding the best solution manual for solid mensuration by Kern and Bland can be a daunting task, but it is not impossible. By following these tips, you can improve your chances of finding a reliable and helpful source that can enhance your learning and understanding of solid mensuration.
