Here are some of the best GTA 5 tips and tricks that you should know:
 
- Use the quick save feature. GTA 5 allows you to save your game anytime and anywhere by using your phone. Simply open the phone menu, go to the Quick Save option, and select a slot to save your progress. This is very handy when you want to avoid losing your money, weapons, or vehicles after dying or failing a mission.
- Switch between characters. GTA 5 lets you play as three different protagonists: Michael, Franklin, and Trevor. Each of them has their own personality, skills, and special abilities. You can switch between them at any time by holding down the character wheel button and selecting the one you want to play as. You can also use this feature to escape from the cops or enemies, as switching characters will reset your wanted level and location.
- Use Franklin's special ability for driving. Franklin has the ability to slow down time while driving any vehicle, which gives him more control and precision. This is very useful for avoiding traffic, making sharp turns, or escaping from pursuers. To activate Franklin's special ability, press the right analog stick (or caps lock on PC) while driving.
- Use Michael's special ability for shooting. Michael has the ability to enter bullet time while aiming any weapon, which allows him to shoot more accurately and deal more damage.

To activate Michael's special ability, press the right analog stick (or caps lock on PC) while aiming.
- Use Trevor's special ability for fighting. Trevor has the ability to enter a rage mode while fighting with any weapon or melee attack, which makes him deal more damage and take less damage. This is very effective for clearing out large groups of enemies, surviving tough situations, or causing chaos. To activate Trevor's special ability, press the right analog stick (or caps lock on PC) while fighting.
- Upgrade your weapons and vehicles. GTA 5 offers a lot of customization options for your weapons and vehicles. You can visit Ammu-Nation stores to buy new weapons, ammo, attachments, and skins.

Upgrading your weapons and vehicles will make them more powerful and efficient.

You can buy and sell stocks using your phone or computer at any time. Investing in stocks can be a great way to earn money quickly or lose money fast depending on your choices. You can also buy properties such as businesses, garages, or safe houses that will generate income over time or provide other benefits.

You can find various collectibles such as letter scraps, spaceship parts, stunt jumps, peyote plants, nuclear waste barrels, and more scattered around the map.

You can also discover hidden easter eggs such as UFOs, aliens, Bigfoot, ghosts, and more if you look hard enough.
