Excel is a powerful tool that can help you analyze the odds and probabilities of different outcomes in Iddaa alt ust betting. In this article, we will show you how to use Excel to create a simple spreadsheet that can calculate the expected value and return on investment of your bets, as well as display the historical data and trends of the matches.
 
## Step 1: Gather the Data
 
The first step is to gather the data you need for your analysis. You will need the following information for each match:
 
- The date and time of the match
- The teams playing
- The odds for alt and ust bets
- The actual number of goals scored

You can find this data from various sources online, such as [iddaa\_alt\_ust\_excel\_sz](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iddaa_alt_ust_excel_sz), which is a npm package that provides Iddaa alt ust data in Excel format[^2^]. Alternatively, you can manually enter the data from websites like [iddaa.com](https://www.iddaa.com/) or [mackolik.com](https://www.mackolik.com/).
 
Once you have the data, you can organize it in a spreadsheet like this:
  | Date       | Time   | Home Team | Away Team | Alt Odds | Ust Odds | Goals | |------------|--------|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|-------| | 23/04/2023 | 16:00  | FenerbahÃ§e | Galatasaray | 1.80     | 1.90     | 3     | | 23/04/2023 | 18:30  | BeÅiktaÅ   | Trabzonspor | 1.70     | 2.00     | 4     | | 23/04/2023 | 21:00  | BaÅakÅehir | Sivasspor   | 1.60     | 2.10     | 1     |  
## Step 2: Calculate the Expected Value and ROI
 
The next step is to calculate the expected value and return on investment of your bets. The expected value (EV) is the average amount of money you can expect to win or lose from a bet in the long run. The return on investment (ROI) is the percentage of profit or loss you can expect from a bet relative to your stake.
 
To calculate the EV and ROI, you need to know the probability of each outcome. You can estimate this probability by using the historical data of the matches and applying some simple formulas.
 
For example, if you want to bet on alt 2.5 goals, you need to know how often the total number of goals scored in a match is less than or equal to 2.5. You can count how many times this happened in your data set and divide it by the total number of matches. This will give you the frequency of alt 2.5 goals.
 
Then, you can multiply this frequency by the odds for alt 2.5 goals to get the expected value of your bet. If the EV is positive, it means that you have an edge over the bookmaker and you can expect to make money in the long run. If the EV is negative, it means that you have a disadvantage and you can expect to lose money in the long run.
 
To calculate the ROI, you simply divide the EV by your stake and multiply by 100%. This will give you the percentage of profit or loss you can expect from your bet relative to your stake.
 
You can use Excel formulas to automate these calculations for each match and each outcome. For example, if
